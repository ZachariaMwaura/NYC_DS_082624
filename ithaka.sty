\opening{Dear Chirag Parekh,}

It is with great excitement that I apply for the Mid-level Machine Learning Engineer opening on the Ithaka data team. I came across the job posting through an article by Tracy Bergstrom and Dylan Ruediger discussing the transformative role of LLM-based tools in knowledge management and research infrastructure. These tools are revolutionizing how researchers interact with collections and are enabling more equitable access to learning. Ithaka's leadership in accessibility and its dedication to bridging educational gaps resonate deeply with my professional values and aspirations.

I have come to the realization that this ``third transformation'' of digital research and the educational landscape is precisely where I want to be. I am currently developing AI-driven solutions for research infrastructure at CUNY's NanoFabrication facility. This includes designing hybrid retrieval systems that combine custom document extraction with relational database integration to preserve tool relationships (e.g., main tools, subcomponents, and notes). We are extending these systems into state-machine-based chat platforms, enabling staff to troubleshoot equipment, develop action plans, and perform root cause analyses. Our ultimate vision is to improve staff experiences and foster user collaboration by streamlining process recipe sharing and device fabrication workflows across research groups.

As a Data Science Instructor at Flatiron School, I've designed and delivered comprehensive lectures spanning data analytics to deep learning for students with diverse educational backgrounds, from high school diploma holders to Ph.D.s. Beyond teaching, I've contributed to developing tools like a Canvas-integrated chat assistant to guide students toward answers rather than providing them outright (via building a reward model to fine-tune responses with RLHF). This has been especially impactful for asynchronous remote learners who cannot always liaison with a live instructional team. These initiatives reflect my conviction that high-quality education should be accessible to learners of all backgrounds, even those with limited time and resources.

I am eager to contribute to Ithaka's impactful initiatives, whether through integrating foundation model-based tools into JSTOR and Portico or tracking metrics and testing the impact of initiatives like easing credit transfers on student retention with Ithaka S\&R. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with Ithaka's goals and how I can contribute to advancing these important efforts.

\closing{With best regards,}

\end{letter}
